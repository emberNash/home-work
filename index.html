		<h2 class="biography__title">Biography</h2>
		<div class="biography__text">Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954.[4] His early schooling was
			suspended in 1967 as a result of the Nigerian Civil War. At 13 years, he served in the Biafran army. After the war
			he completed high-school equivalence through self-study.
			He is married to Dale Brown Emeagwali, a noted African-American microbiologist.[5]

	<div class="education">
		<h2 class="education__title">Education</h2>
		<div class="education__text">He traveled to the United States to study under a scholarship following completion of a
			correspondence course at the University of London. He received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Oregon
			State University in 1977. He later moved to Washington DC, receiving in 1986 a master's degree from George
			Washington University in ocean and marine engineering, and a second master's in applied mathematics from the
			University of Maryland. Next magazine suggested that Emeagwali claimed to have further degrees.[6][7] During this
			time, he worked as a civil engineer at the Bureau of Land Reclamation in Wyoming.

		<h3 class="education__subtitle">Court case and the denial of degree
		</h3>
		<div class="education__text">Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through
			1991. His thesis was not accepted by a committee of internal and external examiners and thus he was not awarded
			the degree. Emeagwali filed a court challenge, stating that the decision was a violation of his civil rights and
			that the university had discriminated against him in several ways because of his race. The court challenge was
			dismissed, as was an appeal to the Michigan state Court of Appeals.[8]

				Emeagwali received the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for an application of the CM-2
				massively-parallel computer. The application used computational fluid dynamics for oil-reservoir modeling. He
				received a prize in "price/performance" category, with a performance figure of about 400 Mflops/$1M.[15] The
				winner in the "performance" category, was also the winner of the Price/performance category, but unable to
				receive
				two prizes. Mobil Research and Thinking Machines, used the CM-2 for seismic data processing and achieved the
				higher ratio of 500 Mflops/$1M. The judges decided on one award per entry.[3][2] His method involved each
				microprocessor communicating with six neighbors.[10]

			<br>
			Emeagwali's simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time approach to reservoir modeling.[1]
